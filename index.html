            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <article class="funParagraph">
               <p>
                  I'm a Registered Nurse living in St. Louis, Missouri, working in Critical Care and Vascular Access. 
                  I have 13 years of experience in healthcare. Recently, I have started a fast-paced web developement
                  course learning foundational skills in JavaScript, React, and additional programming applications.
               </p>
               <p>
                  My current roles as an RN include caring for criticlly ill patients in Intensive Care and assisting 
                  with venous access device placements such as PICC lines and IVs with ultrasound. I strive to provide 
                  excellent, quality patient care while prioritizing patient safety and experience.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Being an RN has given me the opportunity to develop time management skills, critical thinking and 
                  determination. I aspire to be able to use these skills in combination with what I'm learning in 
                  the Web Development course to make a difference in healthcare.
